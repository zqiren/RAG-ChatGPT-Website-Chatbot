Full Stack DeveloperData EngineerSoftware EngineerCyber Risk AnalystSenior Security EngineerArtificial Intelligence / Machine Learning EngineerProduct Manager Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)Will the five modules be conducted simultaneously and when will the bridging modules start? No. The five bridging modules will be offered over a staggered schedule with at most two modules overlapping at any one time. The first series of runs will begin immediately after offers have gone out to successful applicants. You are strongly advised to register for the bridging modules once you receive your offer to ensure you have the opportunity to pass all 5 bridging modules before the matriculation deadline. Each bridging module will run for 6 weeks and the module assessment will be conducted at the end of the 6 weeks. Do I need to be physically at NTU to take the bridging modules? The bridging modules are delivered using both asynchronous and synchronous pedagogies. Students are expected to watch pre-recorded video lessons and work on practice problems given out by the instructor. Learning support in the form of regular weekly scheduled online consultation sessions will be provided for students to video meet with the NTU faculty to discuss the practice exercises and clarify their doubts. However, student should note that the final assessment for each module will be conducted onsite in NTU at a pre-determined date and time published before the start of the bridging module. What if I have secured an offer but I am unable to pass all 5 pre-requisite bridging modules before the matriculation deadline? You are required to pass all 5 bridging modules before you are allowed to matriculate. If you are unable to meet the necessary requirements for matriculation, your current offer will lapse. You should consider carefully if you should re-apply for intake into the next academic year. Applicants who have previously secured an offer will be given due consideration in their re-application if they are able to pass the outstanding bridging module when a re-run of the bridging module assessment is being conducted. The registration of each bridging module is valid for 1 year, allowing you to make two attempts at the module assessment over an academic year. What are the main differences between the B.Tech programme and the B.Eng(Computer Science) programme?Admission requirements are different. For example, the B.Tech programme accepts any polytechnics diplomas while the B.Eng(Computer Science) programme only accepts certain relevant diplomas. The B.Tech programme provides the potential applicants an opportunity to switch to a professional career in computing from other careers. To ensure that a student has the right foundation before starting/matriculation to the B.Tech programme, he/she has to pass the 5 bridging modules.The curriculum of the B.Tech programme aims to train graduates who specialise in one of the three areas. So a B.Tech student does not read the whole set of modules that a B.Eng(Computer Science) student does. The modules in the Foundation stack in the B.Tech programme will provide students with the knowledge necessary for the modules in the Specialist stack which are before the industrial immersion in a job role in their specialisation area. Students have to specialise in one of the three specialisation areas in order to complete the Specialist stack modules and obtain the professional certificate in the area of specialisation. Then they can continue with the on-the-job training in the area of specialisation in industry before obtaining the B.Tech degree. The three areas of specialisations are Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, Cyber Security. In contrast, the B.Eng students may choose to specialise or not specialise in any specific area available in their curriculum.Compared with the B.Eng programme, the B.Tech programme is even more practice-oriented. The teaching of the modules, the assessment methods, the projects to be completed emphasises hands-on learning. The module syllabi are co-developed with our industrial partners to ensure industry relevance. Students are required to complete one whole year of paid on-the-job training, supervised and guided by industrial specialists, before obtaining the degree, compared to the B.Eng students, who have a compulsory 20-Weeks professional Internship during their degree programme. What are the differences between our B.Tech programme and other B.Tech programmes in Singapore?NTU’s WSDeg B.Tech programme may be the most practice-oriented programme. The mini capstone project at the end of Foundation stack modules, the mini capstone project at the end of Specialist stack modules, the industrial capstone project and the on-the-job training will equip you with significant amount of real-world work experiences, in addition to the knowledge and skills you will obtain from your academic modules.

Offered by NTU School of Computer Science and Engineering, the BSc (Hons) in Artificial Intelligence and Society (AISC) aims to:Provide students with a strong technical foundation in AI while cultivating a deep understanding of the societal and ethical implications of AI applications across diverse domains.Equip students with the relevant knowledge and skills necessary for creating AI-based solutions to real-world problems and develop their capacity to identify and address societal risks associated with such solutions throughout the AI lifecycle.Produce socially conscious graduates with strong analytical and problem-solving capabilities, well-equipped to thrive in an increasingly fast-paced AI-driven world rife with both opportunities and profound ethical challenges. The curriculum provides a solid technical foundation in AI and extensive practical exposure to ethical AI system design, development, and deployment in real-world settings and across the entire AI lifecycle. It exposes students to issues related to the societal impact of using AI technology and how some of these AI risks can be identified and mitigated.Through this programme, students will get hands-on experience in an AI in Society group design project, undergo a 20-week industry internship, and, through the Responsible AI (RAI) capstone project, contribute to the design and development of a beneficial AI solution for a specific social or industrial sector of their choice. Essential Modules in AI Ethics and SocietyAI for Social Good introduces students to numerous AI social-impact use cases that will demonstrate how existing AI technologies could contribute to tackling cases across all 17 of the UN’s sustainable-development goals, potentially helping societies in both advanced and emerging countries.Ethical AI provide students with an understanding of the myriad of ethical issues and potential risks involved in the design, development and deployment of AI systems and ways to mitigate such risks. It reviews the changing AI regulatory landscape, with focus on Singapore’s own guidelines and legislation governing data and AI (e.g. PDPA and Model AI Governance Framework).AI for Society introduces the latest emerging development and applications of AI in different domains (e.g. healthcare, fintech, etc). Students will learn about the urgent issues at the intersection of AI and society that needs addressing, including the discussion of AI generated IP & copyright, amplification of misinformation, etc. To encourage a better balance of knowledge from both technical and societal aspects, students will take at least two Major Prescribed Electives (MPE) from each of the baskets of Society and AI Technical electives.

The programme emphasises the practical design of efficient and reliable software to meet specifications. Computer Science shares some common topics with Computer Engineering, including computer networks, information storage and management. Both disciplines share fundamental principles as each recognises the constraints imposed by existing technology and applications. The differences are in the emphasis placed at the algorithmic and conceptual levels. Computer Science focuses more on software design and construction, and does not include subjects on circuits, basic electronics, or digital communications. View SCSE eBrochure The key difference between this Computer Science course and a Science degree is the focus on practice-oriented application of computer science foundations. This is evident in the mandatory industrial attachment, group innovation and design projects, and capstone projects in the final year, and several other mini-projects throughout the course.
